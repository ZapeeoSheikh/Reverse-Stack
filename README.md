# Reverse-Stack
It is not a big problem.
As, We know stack follow Lifo method so when we poped all the elements out of the stack then it will automatically be Reversed.

All we need to know the basic Syntax of Stack and it's implementation

Remember it is a Static Stack 
Static Stack are those who can't be expanded at runtime 
and this senerio is achieved by implementing stack through array 

Array is a Static Data type also a Linear Data Structure.
